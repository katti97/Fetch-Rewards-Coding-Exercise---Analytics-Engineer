# Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise: Analytics-Engineer

The Fetch data-ER diagram PDF allows you to view the relational ER diagram that I created in this exercise using the receipts.json, brands.json, and users.json files. I entered the data into the notebook, converted it from JSON to a dataframe, and looked for any problems, such missing values or possible outliers. Along with the email I sent to stakeholders to let them know how I was doing, I also included the inquiry question in the notebook where I intended to respond to two questions from business stakeholders.
