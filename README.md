# Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise: Analytics-Engineer

The Fetch data-ER diagram PDF allows you to view the relational ER diagram that I created in this exercise using the receipts.json, brands.json, and users.json files. The ER diagram contains one to many and many to many relationships that have been highlighted in the pages of the PDF submitted. I entered the data into the notebook, converted it from JSON to a dataframe, and looked for any problems, such missing values or possible outliers. Along with the email I sent to stakeholders to let them know how I was doing, I also included the inquiry question in the notebook where I intended to respond to two questions from business stakeholders.
